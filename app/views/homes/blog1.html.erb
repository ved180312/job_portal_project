<p>There are many people who are happy with their work, especially if they are in a job that matches their career and life goals. However, even with the best job, there are times when you struggle to find enjoyment in what you are doing. During times of stress or discouragement, finding that joy in work can be difficult. In this article, we will consider why enjoying your job is important and look at some ways you can rediscover the joy in your work.
</p>
<h2>Why it's important to enjoy work</h2>
<p>While you have other things in your life besides work such as friends, family, and hobbies, working is a large part of what you do every week. This is one reason why you should find ways to enjoy your work.<p>
<p>Also, your attitude toward work will affect your mood. If you struggle to find the motivation to go to work and resent the time you are there when you could be elsewhere, you will cultivate a negative attitude that spills over into the rest of your life. It can affect your performance at work, as well as your relationships with co-workers, friends and family.
</p>
<h2>How to enjoy work</h2>
<p>One way to find enjoyment in your work is to look for employment that is compatible with your life and career goals. If your current job is not in alignment with what you most enjoy doing, you are going to be more easily discouraged and dissatisfied with your work. Looking for work that will bring you satisfaction and fulfillment can help you enjoy your job. Here are some tips and strategies to help you increase your enjoyment of work:
</p>
<h4>1. Take breaks</h4>
<p>During a busy workday, it is important you take time away from your desk to get your mind off your job. Schedule a lunch break on your calendar every day and keep it. Even five minutes spent outside if the weather's good, or sitting in the break room, can be good for your mental health and perspective. When you take these breaks, leave your cell phone on your desk. Detach from work completely so you can return refreshed.
</p>
<h4>2. Manage your workspace
</h4>
<p>If your workspace, whether an office or a cubicle, is a mess, tidy it. Throw away anything you don't have to keep. If you have a physical inbox, make sure it only contains things you have yet to do. A clean and organized workspace can help you feel more relaxed and in control of your environment.
</p>
<h4>3. Enjoy the people you work with</h4>
<p>Find ways to have fun in your workplace while maintaining a professional approach to your work. Smile and engage with your co-workers. Get to know them, perhaps even socially outside of work. If you enjoy spending time with the people you work with, this can go a long way toward making your work more enjoyable.
</br>
A positive attitude toward your co-workers can also help you cultivate a positive attitude toward your work. One way to express this is to avoid office gossip and, instead, engage in constructive conversations that encourage your co-workers.
</p>
<h4>4. Upgrade your skills</h4>
<p>Lack of enjoyment in your work might be a sign that you don't find your work challenging enough. You may need to consider personal development so you can take your career to the next level. Find out what training you need in order to progress. If you work in IT, or another field that is constantly changing, you may need to update your skills. In this case, you should investigate classes or appropriate coursework that will keep your skills current and challenge you.

</p>
<h4>5. Accept the imperfect</h4>
<p>It's possible you're feeling frustrated with your co-workers and managers because they do not perform to your expectations. In this case, you need to remember that no-one is perfect, and working with people means working with people who make mistakes and have bad days, just like you. Wherever you work, there will be managers who frustrate you, co-workers who miss deadlines, and projects that don't go to plan. The sooner you can accept the imperfect, the sooner you can manage your frustrations and focus on your work.</p>
